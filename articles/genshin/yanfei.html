            <h1>Collected Miscellany - "Yanfei: Blaze of Legal Brilliance"</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Yanfei is a legal consultant considerate of both reason and humanity in her work.
            <br><br>
            This sincere young lady with the blood of an illuminated beast running through her veins lives a life of joy, but not in excess.</p>

            <iframe width="675" height="380" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5WPg42lHn0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Genshin Impact's Yanfei comes to Teyvat prepared with legal expertise in an effort to solve life's "myriad of problems." The new character's main element is pyro and she can incinerate multiple foes with a cone of flames or spike a volley of fireballs at single targets as if they were volleyballs.
            <br><br>
            Not many Genshin Impact characters face legal trouble, but Yanfei is bringing her legal knowledge to the game in an upcoming update. She's apparently fully versed in every area of the law, from aspects of life being helped and others that are hindered by it. The new pink-haired character known as Yanfei is dressed in an informal outfit of maroon, gold, white, and black which fits the Genshin Impact art design perfectly.
            <br><br>
            One of Yanfei's primary abilities shown off during her reveal trailer shows the new character dropping a giant anvil on the heads of her enemies. When she's on a roll, Yanfei cries out "time for your arraignment," which is a legal term for the reading of charges towards the tail end of a trial prior to a plea.</p>

            <iframe width="675" height="380" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y43rmAQ-l_M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Considering Yanfei's legal background and use of legal terminology, it's likely that fans of the character will learn more about the law by playing Genshin Impact as her. Yanfei is apparently a well-known brilliant young legal advisor who is active in Liyue Harbor. She also has the mixed blood of an illuminated coursing through her veins, making her a force to be reckoned with beyond the courtroom.
            <br><br>
            Yanfei primarily uses pyro to combat her enemies, but the ones who get a little too close will face the wrath of a staff that is adorned with the scales of justice. It's currently unclear if these scales will play a role in her Genshin Impact abilities in the same meaningful way that they're represented in courtrooms. Yanfei's elemental skill is called Signed Edict and it summons intense flames that deal area-of-effect pyro damage to enemies in the area. Successfully landing hits on enemies earn Yanfei Scarlet Seals which are used for other abilities.</p>
