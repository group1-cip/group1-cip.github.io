			<p>Next, let's look in more detail at the specific content in the event~
			<br>
			<strong>Explore Places of Interest</strong>
			<br>
			Your goal is to head to different Places of Interest and retrieve Irminsul Fruit Fragments.</p>

			<br>
			<p>At Places of Interest are strange objects called Mutation Stones, which buff monsters nearby. It is probably a good idea to destroy these Mutation Stones before taking on the monsters.</p>

			<p>There are three types of Irminsul Fruit Fragments that can be retrieved from Places of Interest:</p>

			<p>Now, what can these different fragments do? First, we must understand a special device known as the Energy Amplifier.
			<br><br>
			<strong>Configure the Energy Amplifier</strong>
			<br><br>
			The Energy Amplifier is a device that can activate the Irminsul Fruit Fragments. Equip Irminsul Fruit Fragments onto the device to provide characters in your party with corresponding buffs (this effect is only active in Domains and the Twisted Realm).
			Energy Amplifier Configuration Screen:</p>
			
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821442255407.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">

			<p>Tip: When entering the event Domain while in a Co-Op team, the Energy Amplifier will automatically be switched to the Co-Op Configuration of the host (1P in the party). Please set up your Irminsul Fruit Fragment Co-Op Configuration beforehand.
			Motive Force is consumed when equipping Irminsul Fruit Fragments. Use more Motive Force to equip more and higher quality Irminsul Fruit Fragments.</p>
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821444328026.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">
			
			<p>Your initial Motive Force is relative to the total levels of all your characters. The higher level your characters are, the more Motive Force you have.
			When you run out of Motive Force, you may seek assistance from up to three of your friend's characters to help gain more Motive Force (you may not request assistance when your available Motive Force is full).</p>
			
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821450542536.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">

			<p>During the event, a new Domain will be active when a new act becomes available. When you complete the Domain challenges, you will obtain Fractured Fruit Data and unlock the corresponding Twisted Realm stages. You may only complete each Domain once.</p>
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821452299886.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">

			<p><strong>Challenge the Twisted Realm</strong><br>
			During the event, points can be acquired by challenging the Twisted Realm. Complete corresponding Domain challenges to unlock the Twisted Realm.</p>
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821454630159.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">
			
			<p>Before the challenge begins, you can select the difficulty level and challenge conditions. Upon completion, you will receive points according to the selected difficulty and conditions. You will also receive Primogems the first time you complete each Twisted Realm stage.</p>
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821460331488.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">

			<p>During the event, you can challenge each stage as many times as you wish to get the highest score that you can. Your total combined score is the sum of your high score on each stage challenge. Attain a combined score of certain amounts and you will be able to claim Fractured Fruit Data and the event-exclusive namecard "Celebration: Fruit of Wisdom."</p>
			<img src="https://uploadstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/contentweb/20210428/2021042821462124518.png" alt="Cryo Twisted Realm">
			<p>*Once the event ends, unclaimed Twisted Realm rewards will no longer be available. Please make sure to claim your rewards in time.
			Tip: It is strongly recommended that Travelers team up with friends for these challenges!</p>
