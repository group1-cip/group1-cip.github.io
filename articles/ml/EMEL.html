          <p>Mobile Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) for iOS and Android devices developed and published by Shanghai Moonton Technology, a game development company based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The game was launched in 2016. <br><br>

          main objective being to destroy the opponent’s base. <br><br>

            At the start of the game, each player gets to select a hero. Each hero has a unique set of attributes and skills. There are currently 92 heroes in the game, grouped into 6 different roles: tank, fighter, assassin, marksman, support, and mage.<br><br>

            These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Support heroes, for instance, can buff or heal their teammates. That’s why they should stick with their allies to keep them alive or strong in battle.

            <p><b>Heroes</b><br><br>
            Finding your role is the first step to getting good at Mobile Legends. Learning what role suits you best will not only benefit your gameplay but will also make the game more enjoyable.<br><br>

            In Mobile Legends, there are six classes — </b>Tank</b>, <b>Fighter</b>, <b>Assassin</b>, <b>Mage</b>, <b>Marksman</b>, and <b>Support</b>. Each class is unique, and plays a different role on the team.<br><br>

            <b>Tanks</b> are the shield of the team. These heroes have high health points (HP) and high defense. With their toughness, tanks break up enemy teams and help absorb damage.<br><br>

            If you enjoy being at the front, soaking up tons of damage, then the tank role is made for you.<br><br>

            Examples of tank heroes are <b>Tigreal</b>, <b>Johnson</b> and <b>Grock</b>.</p>

            <br><hr>

            <p><b>Fighters</b> are the brawlers of the team. These heroes have a good balance between HP, defense and damage. Their balanced stats allow these heroes to get in and get out of fights alive.<br><br>

            If you love to be in the thick of the action while killing heroes, being a fighter is the role for you.<br><br>

            Examples of fighter heroes are <b>Chou</b>, <b>Sun</b> and <b>Ruby</b>.</p>

             <img src="https://oneesports.azureedge.net/cdn-data/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MobileLegends_Fighter-1024x607.jpg" alt="Banner" style="margin-top: 0px;">

            <br><hr>
            
            <p><b>Assassins</b> are the ninjas of the team. They have low HP but high damage, roaming the map, ambushing enemies in lane.<br><br>

            If you like being sneaky and taking down enemies, the assassin role is made for you.<br><br>

            Examples of assassin heroes are <b>Fanny</b>, <b>Helcurt</b> and <b>Hayabusa<b>.</p>

            <img src="https://oneesports.azureedge.net/cdn-data/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MobileLegends_Assassin-1024x607.jpg" alt="Banner" style="margin-top: 0px;">

            <br><hr>

            <p><b>Mages</b> are long-range damage dealers with strong abilities. These heroes have high mana and low defense, relying on their powerful spells to chip away at the enemy’s HP and control team fights.<br><br>

            If you enjoy spamming spells to annoy your opponent, picking a mage hero would suit you best.<br><br>

            Examples of Mage heroes are <b>Alice</b>, <b>Eudora</b> and <b>Harith</b>.</p>

            <img src="https://oneesports.azureedge.net/cdn-data/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MobileLegends_Mage-1024x607.jpg" alt="Banner" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <br><hr>

            <p><b>Marksmen</b> are the hero killers of the team. These heroes have high damage but low defense and mobility. Marksmen help eliminate enemy heroes during team fights.<br><br>

            If you love dealing damage and killing heroes, being a marksman is the way to go.<br><br>

            Examples of Marksman heroes are <b>Miya</b>, <b>Layla</b> and <b>Lesley</b></p>
            <img src="https://oneesports.azureedge.net/cdn-data/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MobileLegends_Marksman-1024x607.jpg" alt="Banner" style="margin-top: 0px;">
            <br><hr>

            <p><b>Supports</b> are the backbone of the team. They have high mana and low defense like mages. However, their spells keep their teammates alive.<br><br>

            If you prefer being in the back lines and keeping your team alive, then being a support is best for you.<br><br>

            Examples of support heores are <b>Angela</b>, <b>Diggie</b> and <b>Rafaela</b>.

            </p>
